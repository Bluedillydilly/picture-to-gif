Hello there.

*gif fun with numpy and pil (featuring imageio)*

*TO-DO*
- allow user to provide images to be converted into a gif
- allow for more user interaction
    - user could specify:
        - how many frames the computer generated gif should be
        - dimensions of pictures the computer generated images should be
- allow for more interesting patterns with computer generated pictures.
- look at more time efficient
    - methods that don't require saving the images then appending the image to the gif

*VERSION 0.1*
Program generates 30 images of psuedo-random noise images using numpy for the arrays and PIL to convert the random arrays to .png format. 
Program also creates a gif with each of the 30 images being a frame of the gif. Order of the frames is order the images were created, e.g. initial frame was first image created, last frame was the 30th image created.
Time to create 30 frame, 1024x1024, gif is about 44 seconds.

*PURPOSE*
The purpose of this repository is to practice python while becoming more familiar with the numpy and PIL libraries. I also hope for the project to become an exercise in other topics and areas of interest as well[, like linear algebra and possibly metaheuristic algorithms].
