Hello there.

--gif fun with numpy and pillow (featuring imageio)--

TO-DO
- allow user to provide images to be converted into a gif
- allow for more user interaction
    - user could specify:
        - how many frames the computer generated gif should be
        - dimensions of pictures the computer generated images should be
- allow for more interesting patterns with computer generated pictures.
- look at more time efficient
    - methods that don't require saving the images then appending the image to the gif

VERSION 0.1 (9.26.18 PM)
    - Program generates 30 images of psuedo-random noise images using numpy for the arrays and pillow to convert the random arrays to .png format. 
    - Program also creates a gif with each of the 30 images being a frame of the gif. Order of the frames is order the images were created, e.g. initial frame was first image created, last frame was the 30th image created.
    - Time to create 30 frame, 1024x1024, gif is about 44 seconds.

REQUIREMENTS
    - Libraries needed:
        - numpy
        - pillow
        - imageio
    - Use pip if on Linux
    - Manually download and set paths if on Windows 
        - There is probably a better way but idk dude

PURPOSE
    The purpose of this repository is to practice python while becoming more familiar with the numpy and pillow libraries. I also hope for the project to become an exercise in other topics and areas of interest as well[, like linear algebra and possibly metaheuristic algorithms].
